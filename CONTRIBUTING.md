**Test your changes on the latest Spigot version before making a pull request**
Guidance
If you have never contributed to an open source project, the general workflow is as follows:

Fork this repository
Clone your fork and make your changes
Test changes work
Commit your changes and rebase onto upstream/master if there have been updates since
This to keep a linear commit history and prevent me having to resolve merge conflicts
upstream/master refers to the original repository, you may have to add it as a remote yourself
Push local changes to any branch on your fork
Open a pull request from your branch to master
